### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Ethan Hook
#### Code Architect | Full Stack Developer | Problem Solver ðŸ”§

I'm a passionate welsh developer with a love for crafting web experiences that push boundaries. My favorite tools of the trade are **React** and **Next.js**, which allow me to bring ideas to life on the web.

**Making a difference** in how people browse and use websites is what truly motivates me. As the founder of **EHDevelopment**, I'm on a mission to create innovative digital solutions that enhance user experiences.

In my development journey, I embrace a dynamic approach. I do the design process on the fly, valuing practical coding over elaborate design. **User experience** always takes the front seat in my projects because I believe it's the key to success in the digital world.

Here are a couple of my favorite quotes that guide my path:
- *"People who succeed hit many failures and potholes; that's what makes you stronger."*
